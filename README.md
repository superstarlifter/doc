## StarLifter Documentation

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/superstarlifter/doc/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Built using Docsify

```npm i docsify-cli -g```

Everything can still be written in markdown. Just add the file and update _sidebar.md to build out the navigation.
