## Creating a pipeline
Users clean and reformat collections by creating lists of commands, or pipelines. Users also have the ability to save pipelines so they can be used again in the future.

A pipeline is applied to a StarLifter collection. To begin, select the collection you wish to clean and reformat.

### Common manipulator commands
The commands below can be accessed by right-clicking within the collection preview.

* **Delete rows like this:** Delete rows that contain the selected value
* **Set as header row:** Set the selected row to be the header row
* **Create field using value:** Create a field in which each row contains the selected value
* **Change field name:** Change the name of the field
* **Merge two fields:** Concatenate the values of two fields in the same row
* **Split into multiple fields:** Split a single field into multiple fields based on a delimiter
* **Filter:** Filter the collection
* **Fill empty values from prior rows:** Automatically fill blank cells with the values from the prior row
* **Reference another collection:** Convert a field to a reference field from another collection, and pull in additional values from the referenced collection
* **Join fields from another collection:** Left-join on fields from another collection
* **Delete field:** Remove a field from the collection
* **Copy field:** Duplicate the field within the collection
* **Rotate fields to rows:** Unpivot or flatten data by putting selected rows into a single column
* New field: Add a new field to the collection

### Building and saving a pipeline
As you execute new plans to the collection, you'll notice StarLifter keeps track of your list of commands in the pipeline.

Although you do not have to save your pipeline to save your output collection, you can do so by selecting Save as in the **Pipeline** dropdown.

Once a pipeline is saved, it is available to be ran on other collections.

### Saving a collection

2. Click Save as from the **Save to collection** dropdown to create a new collection, or select the collection you wish to overwrite.
