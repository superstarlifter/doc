## Create a Reference
A reference field stores a reference to a field in another collection. For example, the Account field in a General Ledger collection is a reference to the Chart of Accounts collection.

When you define a reference field, the system creates a relationship between the two collections. Adding a reference field to a form makes the other fields in the referenced collection available as well.

### Set up reference field
1. Right click on the field to reference to another collection âž” **Fields**

2. Change **Data Type** to Reference
