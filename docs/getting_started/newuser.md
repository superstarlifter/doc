## Welcome to StarLifter

This article is for Organization Administrators who have been invited to a partially or fully implemented organization in StarLifter.

To get acquainted with the organization:
1.  Briefly review the dashboards to get a sense of the types of analysis completed to date.  To do this, select the downward arrow next to the dashboard name.

2.  Briefly review the collections of data in the organization.  You can toggle through the collections on the ribbon below the dashboards.

There are different ways a collection is added.  It's not critical for you to review the types now; however, make it a point to come back and read through the following:

 * [Creating a new collection](https://docs.starlifter.io/#/how_to/new)
 * [Uploading a collection from a spreadsheet](https://docs.starlifter.io/#/getting_started/quick-start?id=upload-data)
 * [Uploading new data to an existing collection](https://docs.starlifter.io/#/how_to/tag)
 * [Creating a view](https://docs.starlifter.io/#/how_to/view)
 * [Creating a join](https://docs.starlifter.io/#/how_to/join)

3.  Understanding your role in maintaining the data is one of the most important factors of your onboarding.  Look for a collection called **Data Sources**.  This collection provides a list of each source collection, where it comes from and how it is maintained.  Based on your role in data maintenance, review the help desk references above.
